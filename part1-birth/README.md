Have you ever watched a superhero origin story? It always starts the same: a seemingly ordinary character suddenly gains incredible abilities. At first, they're unsure, clumsy, and even vulnerable. But as time goes on, with the proper guidance, they learn, grow, and eventually become something truly powerfulâ€Š-â€Ša hero capable of changing the world.

Imagine creating your own superheroâ€Š-â€Šnot a person, but an **AI companion**. One that begins as a newborn, learning and evolving with each new skill you teach it. That's precisely what we're about to embark on: the **Odyssey of your AI companion**.

**Together**, we'll guide it from its humble beginnings to its eventual transformation into a super-powered assistant that can handle anything you throw at it.

The best part? You don't need to be a seasoned developer to bring your companion to life. With tools like **UV, Chainlit**, and **AWS Bedrock**, this journey is accessible to everyone, step by step.

Are you ready to start your own superhero origin story? Let's dive in and begin this epic journey! ðŸš€

    > In our case we use **python 3.12**.


    **With uv**

    ```
    uv pip install --system -r requirements.txt
    ```

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
    AWS_REGION=us-east-1
